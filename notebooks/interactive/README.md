# Interactive Notebooks â€” Important Information

## About this notebook

This folder contains interactive Jupyter notebooks that include **ipywidgets** for dynamic visualizations.

### GitHub rendering limitation

GitHub does **not fully support** notebooks with widgets, so you might see an **"Invalid Notebook"** error or the notebook may not render properly here.
