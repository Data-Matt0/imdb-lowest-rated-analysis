This folder contains **sampled subsets** of the official [IMDb Datasets](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/). Each file has been reduced to approximately 1,000 rows for testing, development, and repository portability.

## Files

- `sample_title.basics.csv`
- `sample_title.ratings.csv`
- `sample_name.basics.csv`
- `sample_title.crew.csv`
- `sample_title.principals.csv`

## Notes

- These files are **not used** in the final analysis notebooks.
- Full-sized files were originally used and processed in the `data/filtered_data/` folder.
- These samples are retained for educational/testing purposes and to illustrate original schema and structure.
